Drug Discovery: Predicting Molecular Activity with Machine Learning


This repository contains a Springboard project which was done to predict molecular activity with biological targets based on molecule features. The repository contains the following:

### Data_cleaning.ipynb
This takes the raw data (not included since the files are quite large) and converts them to smaller data files through cleaning and feature engineering.

### machine_learning_analysis_final.ipynb
This performs the final machine learning analysis described in the paper on the updated data.

### Data
This is not the raw data, but the data which is obtained after performing the cleaning and feature engineering from the data cleaning IPython notebook.
 
### capstone2_paper_udate.pdf
This is the final paper which has all information about the procedure, plots, analysis, etc.

### Drug_discovery_ppt.ppt 
This is the slide deck which has slides describing the procedure and giving some visuals.
